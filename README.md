A game about what the NCIS writers think hacking is.

#Copyright
The original game of H4X0R was made at DigiPen and was more of a proof-of-concept. Since the code for the old Java version is owned by them, I can't put it on here. However, I can start from scratch remaking the game with HTML5 and [Phaser](http://phaser.io/) reusing the assets from the pre-alpha made in Java.
